![example workflow](https://github.com/darwinphi/digitrivia/actions/workflows/.github/workflows/gh_pages.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)

A trivia app created with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) I recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
